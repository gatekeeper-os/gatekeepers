# Writing a gatekeeper

A gatekeeper is an OpenClaw plugin, built with `@gatekeeper-os/gatekeeper-kit`, that is the *only* way an agent reaches one external
service. Read `docs/implementation-plan.md` §4 first; `packages/gkos-gatekeeper-github` is the reference; `packages/gatekeeper-kit/SKELETON.md`
is the template. There are two mandatory STOP points below — do not proceed past either without operator approval. If no
operator is present, write what needs review into `plans/REVIEW-REQUESTED.md` and end the run.

## Phase 1 — responsibilities 1–3 (auth, API design, granting)

1. **Understand the service.** Auth model (OAuth web/device, PAT, none). Resource types and the granularities that are
   *meaningful* to grant (a repo, an issue — not a single field). Which operations are observations (reads) and which are
   actions (writes). Which actions are reversible.
2. **Design the tool surface** in `src/tools.ts` and resources in `src/resources.ts`: a small group of tools per resource type;
   every tool takes `grant`; structured inputs/outputs, not raw API payloads; simplify for the common case; names
   `gk_<vendor>_<resource>_<verb>`; descriptions say what the tool does and never mention approvals, queues, caching, OAuth,
   or simulation. Decide the URL patterns `getGatekeeperFor()` matches.
3. **STOP 1 — present the tool surface and URL patterns for operator review.** Getting the API right is the most important
   and delicate part; getting it wrong means rebuilding.
4. **Implement** `vendor.ts` (describe, connectAccount with `OAuthNonceMachine`, getAccount via `TokenStore`, resources, tools),
   `account.ts` (`getGatekeeperFor(url)` validates access with the operator's own credentials), one `KitGatekeeper` subclass per
   resource type. Pass credentials and resource ids through constructors from the account, never through tool params.
5. **Register declaratively** with `defineGatekeeper()`: the root `openclaw.plugin.json` id must match the definition id
   (`gkos-gatekeeper-<vendor>`), and `contracts.tools` must list exactly the names in `src/tools.ts` (no missing, extra, or
   duplicate names). Include `"gkos": { "gatekeeper": { "vendor": "<v>", "apiVersion": 1 } }`; `package.json` with
   `openclaw.compat` from the catalog; and `deploy-inputs.json`. The kit validates the actual root manifest at registration
   and owns the upstream tool wrappers under this gatekeeper's plugin identity; driver code never calls `api.registerTool`.
   Every wrapper dispatches through the kernel's grant checks and observation/action pipeline; registration does not grant access.
   Add the reviewed gatekeeper to `config/gatekeepers.json` and the cell's `os/gatekeepers.json` catalog, then run
   `gkos config apply` for that cell. Catalog reconciliation admits enabled gatekeeper plugin ids in the messaging profile's
   `tools.alsoAllow` and removes their managed admission when removed/disabled. Do not hand-add tool names to the kernel's
   manifest or widen its global surface. Preserve native denials, the runtime profile's explicit `tools.allow`, and sandbox settings.
6. **STOP 2 — ask the operator whether to proceed to Phase 2.**

## Phase 2 — responsibilities 4–7 (approvals, caching, simulation, observers)

7. **Approvals.** Every read awaits `queue.authorizeObservation()` before returning data (may be called after fetching, must be
   awaited before returning). Every write is an `ActionImpl` with `describe()` (dry pass), `simulate()`, `apply()`, optional
   `revert()`. Set `implementsRevert` truthfully; set `awaitDecision: true` only when simulation is impossible. Otherwise the
   security model is broken.
8. **Caching** in the gatekeeper's `cache/` store. **Simulation**: overlay-at-read (kit default) or mutate-the-cache; re-apply
   queued actions whenever the cache refreshes.
9. **Observers.** Choose per resource type: A private-only, B ACL check, C dataset tracking, D low-stakes. Use C only when the
   binding spans sub-resources with distinct ACLs *and* there is a per-observer oracle. Distinguish "no access" (403/404 →
   false) from transient errors (throw) so failures are loud.
10. **Conformance**: `pnpm conformance --only deferred-approval,require-approval-roundtrip` plus the kit harness tests; the
    secret-leak grep must pass. Verify the packed model-turn gate with a tool absent from the kernel manifest: it is hidden
    without a grant, available with the correct owner grant, and rejected without authority. A manifest/declaration check or
    successful build alone is not model-turn evidence; retain exact denial and effective policy on failure.

## Gotchas
- `types`/descriptions leak nothing about internals; the agent must not be able to tell an action was simulated.
- Never store the approval queue beyond the session; never mint tools yourself.
- Log numeric error codes only — vendor error messages can echo caller input.
